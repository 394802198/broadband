						Differences between 3G (or 4G) and WiFi
					</h1>
				</div>
				<p>
					Both 3G (and 4G) and WiFi provide user can access Internet services by wireless application. The major difference between these two is the method that connect with Internet. 3G (and 4G) obtain the wireless services through mobile phone suppliers.  
				</p>
				<p>
					It means the range of coverage is as big as the mobile phone coverage. However, the costs of 3G (and 4G) will be as high as the mobile bills. Moreover, the radio wave also will be effected by the specific states of mobile antenna stations. WiFi coverage normally based on one of the local access point (or hot spot).   
				</p>
				<p>
					 It is more private wireless network that is set by private use, like home, work place, or customer use only. The radio wave is only available in a local fixed area, but it is stable and fast speed. At the same time, the cost saving is the most important to the most of users.
